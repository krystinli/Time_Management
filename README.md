# Time_Management
> Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.

This repo is designed to track my time management in these 3 areas: **work, development, and self-care**. I want to make sure I invest a bit in each of the 3 areas everyday for a good habit formation. 

### How does it work?
I set up an expecation for the current monitoring period (outlined [here](https://github.com/krystinli/Time_Management/blob/main/run.py#L69-L75)) and then update inputs with my activities. The embedded logic computes a performance rating that shows whether I'm able to hit my target. A positive rating means I'm hitting the target; a negative rating means otherwise. 
- Performance is calculated by: `Performance = Expected Hours - Actual Hours`
- Overall goal: To meet my target consistenly and smooth out the productivity curve
