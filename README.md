# Time_Management
This repo is designed to track my hours spent in different categories of development. I believe the prerequisite of development is tracking time management - you need to have a clear picture on the time investment in activities in order to motivate yourself to improve. [goal](https://github.com/krystinli/Inner_Space/blob/master/Timeline/2021-01-17_%E2%80%9C%E6%BC%94%E5%91%98%E2%80%9D%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%9E%E7%94%9F.md#%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E6%AD%A513%E6%9C%88)

## 00_Summary
This section tracks the total time spent in development: the first plot is **Past 10 Days** and second plot is **Past 60 Days**.

### Leetcode
Time investment is an early indicator, where # of leetcode completed is a reflection/result of the time investment (in coding).

## 01_Categories
Development is broken down into 4 categories: (in the plot 2 and 4 are combined)
1. `work` Work Coding and Analysis
2. `ds_project` DS side Project or Medium blogging
3. `coding` Coding Exercise (like Leetcode, Hackerank, etc.) or Theory Based Reading
4. `planning` Agile, Finance, Career Planning, Home Improvement, etc.
