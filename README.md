# Time_Management
This repo is designed to track hours spent in 3 important areas: **work, development, and self-care**. This provides a clear picture on the time investment I made towards my [goal](https://github.com/krystinli/Inner_Space/blob/master/Timeline/2021-01-17_%E2%80%9C%E6%BC%94%E5%91%98%E2%80%9D%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%9E%E7%94%9F.md#%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E6%AD%A513%E6%9C%88) and hopefully helps me to stay focused on what I want to spend majority of my time on.
