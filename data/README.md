# Version_Control
This sheet tracks my updates for benchmarking according to my short term goals 🎯. The actual hours are meaningless without the comparison to benchmark hours. 
- For example, if I decided to lose weight which requires more workout 🏋️‍♀️ I would raise the hours for `self-care` to reflet that
- To keep a healthy balance, I would reduce hours in some other area to make the goal more realistic 

### 📆 Update on `2022-10-02`

```

### 📆 Update on `2022-07-11`

    # current benchmark setting for weekend
    weekend_work_exp=0,
    weekend_dev_exp=0.25,
    weekend_care_exp=1,
```

### 📆 Update on `2022-03-22` 💻

```py
    weekday_work_exp=0.5,
    weekday_dev_exp=0.5,

```py
    # current benchmark setting for weekday
    weekday_work_exp=0.25,
    weekday_dev_exp=0.25,
    weekday_care_exp=1,
    # current benchmark setting for weekend
    weekend_work_exp=0.25,
    weekend_dev_exp=0.25,
    weekend_care_exp=1,
```

### 📆 Update on `2022-02-07`
- Increase time for self-care again as I'm getting close to due date
- Reduce work hours 
```py
    weekday expecation:
        work = 1 hr
        development = 0.5 hr
        self-care = 2 hr
        total = 3.5 

    weekend expecation:
        work = 1 hr
        development = 0.5 hr
        self-care = 2 hr
        total = 3.5
```

**Reflection**
- Do more exercise to help with labour

        self-care = 1 hr
        total = 3.5 

    weekend expecation:
        work = 0 hr
        development = 1 hr -> 0.5 hr
