## Target_Update
This sheet tracks my updates for benchmark according to my short term goals üéØ
- For example, if I decided to lose weight which requires more workout üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è than normal 
- I would raise the hours for `development` to include that expectation

**Update on `2021-11-23`**
- Reduce work on weekend
- Improve development expectation
```py
    weekday expecation:
        work = 2 hr
        development = 0.75 hr
        self-care = 0.25 hr
        total = 3 

    weekend expecation:
        work = 0 hr
        development = 1.5 hr
        self-care = 0.5 hr
        total = 2
```
