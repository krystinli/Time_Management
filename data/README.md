# Version_Control
This sheet tracks my updates for benchmarking according to my short term goals 🎯. The actual hours are meaningless without the comparison to benchmark hours. 
- For example, if I decided to lose weight which requires more workout 🏋️‍♀️ I would raise the hours for `self-care` to reflet that
- To keep a healthy balance, I would reduce hours in some other area to make the goal more realistic
