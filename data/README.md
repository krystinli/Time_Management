## Target_Update
This sheet tracks my updates for benchmark according to my short term goals 🎯
- For example, if I decided to lose weight which requires more workout 🏋️‍♀️ than normal 
- I would raise the hours for `self-care` to include that expectation

**Update on `2021-11-23`**
- Increase time for self-care
- Reduce expectation for development 
```py
    weekday expecation:
        work = 2 hr
        development = 1 hr -> 0.5 hr
        self-care = 1 hr
        total = 3.5 

    weekend expecation:
        work = 0 hr
        development = 1 hr -> 0.5 hr
        self-care = 1 hr -> 1.5 hr
        total = 2
```

**Reflection**
- Do more exercise to increase overall productivity
- More updates on the tracker

**Update on `2021-11-23`**
- Increase time for self-care
- Smooth the expectation for development (1 hr everyday throughout the week)
```py
    weekday expecation:
        work = 2 hr
        development = 1 hr
        self-care = 0.5 hr
        total = 3.5 

    weekend expecation:
        work = 0 hr
        development = 1 hr
        self-care = 1 hr
        total = 2
```
