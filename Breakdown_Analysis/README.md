## Breakdown_Analysis
For each month, I want to create a mini-focus on one of the 3 categories and break that one into smaller sub-categories for close monitoring.

### 2022_Jan 📆
For this month, I want to deep dive into "self-care" caregory by focusing on these 3 activities:
- Workout 🏋️‍♀️
- Meditation 🍃
- Napping 😴
